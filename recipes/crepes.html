    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a recipe that has been on my family for generations. We serve this on special occasions like Christmas and weddings, but it is really easy to make. Serve with a green leafy salad.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups skim milk</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon melted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 pound zucchini blossoms, rinsed and chopped</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh epazote leaves (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container creme fraiche</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups half-and-half cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Manchego cheese</li>


    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place the eggs, milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, melted butter, and flour into a blender.<br>
             Blend until no dry lumps of flour remain in the batter. Scrape down the sides of the blender as needed. <br>
             Heat an oiled, non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour in enough batter to cover half of the skillet.<br>
              Tip and rotate the skillet until the batter covers the entire area. <br>
              Cook until the batter turns from wet to moist, and the edges begin to curl away from the sides of the skillet.<br>
               Turn the crepe over, and continue cooking until lightly golden on the other side. Place the crepe onto a plate, <br>
               and cover with a kitchen towel to keep moist. Repeat with the remaining batter, lightly oiling the skillet as needed to keep the crepes from sticking. </li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion, and cook until <br>
            the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.<br>
             Pour in the chicken broth, and simmer until reduced to half its original volume. Stir in the chopped zucchini blossoms, cover, <br>
             and cook a few minutes until the squash blossoms have softened and reduced in volume. <br>
             Stir in the tomato, nutmeg, and epazote until the tomato begins to soften, about 2 minutes. <br>
             Add the creme fraiche, then season to taste with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Roll about 2 tablespoons of zucchini filling in each crepe, and place into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour the half-and-half cream evenly over top of the crepes,<br>
             and sprinkle with grated Manchego cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil, tenting if necessary so the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crepes are hot and the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
