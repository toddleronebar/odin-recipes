    <h1>Pot Stickers</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Pot stickers are a type of dumpling that are believed to have originated in China.<br>
         Pot stickers are typically filled with ground pork and cabbage, but they can be stuffed with other ingredients too. <br>
          They're usually pan-fried and steamed to give a soft, tender texture to the filling and a crunchy texture to the dumpling dough.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons very finely minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped green cabbage</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water, about 130 -150 F (55-65 C)</li>
    </ul>    

        <h3>Dipping Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>For Frying:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying, or as needed - divided</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons water for steaming, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne in a mixing bowl. <br> 
            Top with chopped green cabbage. Mix with fork until thoroughly combined. Tamp down lightly; cover with plastic. <br> 
            Refrigerate until chilled, about an hour. </li>
        <li>Place 2 1/2 cups of flour and kosher salt in a mixing bowl. <br> 
            Slowly pour in hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a shaggy dough. <br> 
            Flour your hands and transfer dough to a work surface. Knead dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 3 to 5 minutes. <br>
            If dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour, up to an additional 1/2 cup, and continue to knead. <br>
             Wrap dough ball in plastic, and let it rest about 30 minutes. </li>

        <li>When dough has rested, divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 pieces with a dish cloth while you work the first piece. <br> 
            Roll into a small log about the thickness of a thumb, about 3/4 inch. Divide each log into 6 equal pieces. <br>
            Roll each piece into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle on a lightly floured surface to form the pot sticker wrappers. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces. </li>
        <li>Lightly moisten the edges of a wrapper with your wet finger. <br>
            Place a small scoop of the ground pork mixture onto the center of a wrapper. <br>
             Fold up the 2 sides and pinch together in the center. <br>
             Pinch together the remaining edges, forming "pleats" along one side. <br>
             Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to slightly flatten the bottom; form a slight curve in it so it stands upright in the pan.<br>
              Transfer to a well-floured plate. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Mix together seasoned rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small mixing bowl for the dipping sauce. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place about 6 or 7 pot stickers in the hot oil, flat side down.<br>
             Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. <br>
              Drizzle in water and quickly cover the pan; steam for 3 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium. <br>
              Continue cooking until water evaporates and bottoms are browned and crunchy, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to a warm serving dish. <br>
              Repeat with remaining pot stickers. Serve with dipping sauce. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
